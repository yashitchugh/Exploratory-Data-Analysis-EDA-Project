# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains a structured approach to performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset. The goal is to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data using visualizations and descriptive statistics.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

### 1. Generate Summary Statistics
- Computed **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, **min**, **max**, and **quartiles** for all numeric features.
- Identified missing values and potential outliers using descriptive methods.

### 2. Visualize Numeric Features
- Created **histograms** to analyze the distribution of each numeric variable.
- Plotted **boxplots** to detect outliers and compare distributions across features.

### 3. Examine Feature Relationships
- Built a **pairplot** using Seaborn to visualize relationships between numerical features.
- Constructed a **correlation matrix** with a heatmap to observe the strength and direction of linear relationships.

### 4. Identify Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies
- Observed clustering patterns, skewed distributions, and extreme values.
- Highlighted potential data issues or irregularities needing further cleaning or transformation.

### 5. Draw Feature-Level Inferences
- Made basic inferences from visuals, such as:
  - Which features are skewed?
  - Are there linear relationships?
  - Which features show high variability?
  - Presence of strong correlations or multicollinearity?

## âœ… How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone[https://github.com/yashitchugh/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project]
   cd eda_project


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the EDA notebook in `notebooks/` directory using Jupyter or any preferred IDE.


## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Outputs

* Histograms showing skewed vs. normal distributions.
* Boxplots identifying outliers.
* Correlation heatmaps showing strong positive/negative relationships.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

This EDA helps in:

* Building intuition about the dataset.
* Identifying data quality issues early.
* Informing the direction for feature engineering and modeling steps.
